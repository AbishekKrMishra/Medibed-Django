Web application for booking hospital beds - 
My project is a web application titled ‘MEDIBED’ which is very much useful in the field of medical. The prime aim of these application is that in the present scenario, due to pandemic it’s
an obvious danger out there to visit each hospital to look for a bed. It is mostly time consuming and risk involving, visitor may need to visit multiple hospitals in case beds are not available in
places. And standing in a queue and making a rush and crowd is an obvious risk. To overcome such unwanted risks, we designed an E-Hospital Bed Booking System so that the patients can
book their beds in a faster and easier way without making any chaos outside the hospitals. This will save the time for the visitors and for hospitals as well.

The application by developed by me and my classmate 'YAMAN GOYAL' during our graduation 2nd year.
